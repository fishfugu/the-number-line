The Greek mathematician Diophantus (3rd century AD) considered problems leading to cubic equations in his Arithmetica, an early appearance of an elliptic curve in disguise (Overview of History of Elliptic Curves and its use in cryptography). In the 17th\u201319th centuries, elliptic integrals (arising from the arc length of an ellipse) and elliptic functions were intensely studied by Newton, Euler, Abel, and Jacobi. Their work, though analytic in nature, laid the groundwork by revealing the rich structure of these curves. By the late 19th century, Henri Poincar\u00e9 had unified and generalized much of this theory, recognizing that certain cubic curves have a group structure and hinting at deep connections with complex analysis and topology.</p> <p>Mordell\u2019s Theorem (1922) and Rational Points: A major breakthrough in the arithmetic of elliptic curves came with Louis J. Mordell. In 1922 Mordell proved that for an elliptic curve E defined over the rational numbers \\mathbb{Q}, the set of rational solutions E(\\mathbb{Q}) forms a finitely generated abelian group (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute). In simple terms, although there might be infinitely many rational points, they all arise from a finite basis of \u201cgenerator\u201d points. This result, now known as the Mordell\u2013Weil theorem, was a cornerstone: it guaranteed a finite description of all rational solutions on E. Mordell\u2019s theorem answered a question posed by Poincar\u00e9 and established the study of the rank (number of independent generators) of elliptic curves as a central question (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute) (Elliptic Curves). Subsequent work by Andr\u00e9 Weil generalized this finite generation to elliptic curves over number fields (the Mordell\u2013Weil theorem in full generality).</p> <p>Hasse\u2019s Theorem (1933) and Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields: In the 1930s, Helmut Hasse investigated elliptic curves modulo a prime p. Hasse proved an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis for these curves, showing that if N(p) is the number of solutions mod p, then |N(p) - (p+1)| \\le 2\\sqrt{p} (Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves - Wikipedia) (Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves - Wikipedia). This result (published in 1936) provided a precise estimate (the Hasse bound) on the number of points over finite fields and was later understood as a special case of the Weil conjectures. It introduced L-functions in the context of elliptic curves: one can encode the numbers N(p) into a generating function (the Hasse\u2013Weil L-series of the curve). Hasse\u2019s work thus bridged elliptic curves and complex analytic functions, foreshadowing deeper connections between elliptic curves and modular forms.</p> <p>Conjectures and Breakthroughs (1950s\u20131970s): Post-WWII, elliptic curves became a central object in number theory. In 1955, Japanese mathematicians Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura conjectured a remarkable connection between elliptic curves and modular forms (News from the world of maths: Mathematical moments | plus.maths.org). Their conjecture (refined by Andr\u00e9 Weil in 1967 and often called the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture) proposed that every elliptic curve defined over \\mathbb{Q} is \u201cmodular,\u201d meaning it corresponds to a modular form of weight 2. This bold hypothesis, initially greeted with skepticism (Modularity of Elliptic Curves - William Stein), implied that the L-function of an elliptic curve equals the L-function of some modular form. Around the same time, Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer at Cambridge used early computers to gather data on elliptic curves. By the mid-1960s, they formulated the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture: an enigmatic link between the rank of E(\\mathbb{Q}) and the behavior of its L-function L(E,s) (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute). In essence, the BSD conjecture claims that the number of independent rational points (the rank) is encoded in the analytic properties of L(E,s) at s=1 (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute). This conjecture, still unproved in general, is one of the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems and has driven vast research. Another fundamental result came in 1977 when Barry Mazur proved the Torsion Theorem, classifying all possible finite-order rational points on elliptic curves. Mazur showed that the only possible torsion subgroups of E(\\mathbb{Q}) are a short list of 15 groups (cyclic groups of orders 1\u201310, 12, or their direct products with a cyclic group of order 2) (Torsion conjecture - Wikipedia). This result, conjectured earlier by Beppo Levi and others, highlights a striking uniformity: no elliptic curve over \\mathbb{Q} can have a torsion point of (say) order 11 or 13, etc., outside that list.</p> <p>Modern Advances (1980s\u20131990s): The late 20th century witnessed resolutions of long-standing conjectures. In 1983, Gerd Faltings (at the Institute for Advanced Study) proved the Mordell Conjecture (now Faltings\u2019 Theorem) that any algebraic curve of genus &gt; 1 has only finitely many rational points, underscoring elliptic curves (genus 1) as the critical case for infinite rational solutions. The crowning achievement came in 1994 when Andrew Wiles proved a special case of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute). Specifically, Wiles (with contributions by Richard Taylor) showed that all semistable elliptic curves over \\mathbb{Q} are modular (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute). This breakthrough also solved Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem as a corollary (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute): by earlier work of Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, a counterexample to Fermat\u2019s equation would produce a non-modular elliptic curve, contradicting the now-proved modularity theorem (News from the world of maths: Mathematical moments | plus.maths.org). Wiles\u2019s result was later extended (Breuil, Conrad, Diamond, Taylor, 2001) to modularity of all elliptic curves over \\mathbb{Q}, now known as the Modularity Theorem. This theorem establishes a powerful \u201cdictionary\u201d between elliptic curves and modular forms, confirming Taniyama\u2019s 1955 insight (Elliptic Curves). It also provided tools to prove new cases of the Birch\u2013Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in rank 0 and 1 situations. Through the 1990s and 2000s, researchers like Gross\u2013Zagier and Kolyvagin made progress on BSD (proving it when the rank is 0 or 1), and others (e.g. Henri Darmon, Christopher Skinner) have formulated p-adic analogues aiming to tackle higher-rank cases. The Sato\u2013Tate conjecture (on the distribution of Hasse\u2019s error term) was proven for many elliptic curves (2006, by Taylor et al.), reflecting the continued vitality of elliptic curve theory. Today, the subject remains vibrant, with recent work by mathematicians like Manjul Bhargava (bounding average ranks) and Jennifer Balakrishnan (computing rational points using p-adic methods) pushing the frontiers.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/03/09/another-draft-of-the-scope-and-possible-structure-for-my-masters-thesis.html#fundamental-results-and-notable-publications","title":"Fundamental Results and Notable Publications","text":"<p>Elliptic curve theory has been chronicled in many influential papers and books.

The first cryptographic application came in 1985, when Victor Miller (then at IBM) and Neal Koblitz (at University of Washington) independently proposed using elliptic curves to construct public-key cryptosystems (Curve Selection in Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Their idea, introduced in the proceedings of CRYPTO 1985 (Springer LNCS) and a 1987 journal article, was that the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) could serve as a hard one-way problem for cryptography (Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography \u2014 Evervault). In an elliptic curve group, given a base point P and another point Q = nP (scalar multiplication repeated n times), it is computationally difficult to recover the integer n \u2013 analogous to the classical discrete log problem in multiplicative groups, but with much smaller parameter sizes for equal security. Miller and Koblitz\u2019s work founded Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), a new class of public-key schemes.</p> <p>Advantages and Adoption: ECC offers strong security with significantly smaller keys than RSA or Diffie\u2013Hellman. For example, a 256-bit elliptic curve key is roughly comparable to a 3072-bit RSA key in strength. This efficiency gain (in speed and memory) led to rapid adoption of ECC in practice (Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography \u2014 Evervault). By the mid-1990s, standards bodies and industry began to include ECC. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promoted ECC-based digital signatures (ECDSA) and key exchange (ECDH) in FIPS standards. In the 2000s, ECC became the backbone of secure web protocols: for instance, the majority of TLS/SSL connections today rely on elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman for key exchange (Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography \u2014 Evervault). ECC is also integral to cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin\u2019s public-key addresses use the secp256k1 curve) and many mobile device security systems, underscoring its practical importance.</p> <p>Notable Cryptographic Contributions: A few key developments link the theoretical and practical realms of elliptic curves:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Lenstra\u2019s Factoring Algorithm (1987): Even before ECC proper, Hendrik Lenstra Jr. demonstrated the power of elliptic curves in computation by devising an elliptic curve method for integer factorization (Lenstra\u2019s Algorithm | Programming Praxis). Lenstra\u2019s algorithm uses random elliptic curves to find small factors of large integers and runs in sub-exponential time. It was the first practical application of elliptic curves in cryptography, predating widespread ECC, and remains the best method for finding medium-sized prime factors (up to ~50 digits) (Lenstra\u2019s Algorithm | Programming Praxis).</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure Curve Design and Standards: Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, research focused on selecting secure curve parameters. Algorithms like Schoof\u2019s algorithm (1985) made it feasible to count points on a curve over a finite field efficiently, which is crucial for selecting curves of prime order (to avoid small subgroups). Seminal papers by Daniel Menezes, Scott Vanstone, and others at Certicom/University of Waterloo investigated the security of various elliptic curve families, including supersingular curves (which were later used in pairing-based cryptography) and anomalous curves (cautioning against those with known vulnerabilities). The Menezes\u2013Okamoto\u2013Vanstone (MOV) result in 1993 showed how some elliptic curve instances could be attacked using the Weil pairing, reinforcing the need for careful parameter choices. Consequently, standards bodies chose specific \u201cNIST curves\u201d and other well-studied curves for public use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pairing-Based Cryptography: Ironically, the same pairings that enabled the MOV attack also unlocked new positive applications. In 2000\u20132001, Antoine Joux and Dan Boneh\u2013Matt Franklin showed that the Weil and Tate pairings on elliptic curves (mathematical bilinear maps) can be used to construct innovative schemes like identity-based encryption and short signatures. These developments, built on elliptic curve pairings, expanded the cryptographic toolkit and led to notable papers in the early 2000s bridging number theory and cryptography.</p> </li> <li> <p>Post-Quantum Considerations: The advent of quantum algorithms (Shor\u2019s algorithm, 1994) poses a future threat to ECC (as it does to RSA), because a sufficiently large quantum computer could solve the discrete log problem on elliptic curves in polynomial time (Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography \u2014 Evervault). This has spurred research into post-quantum cryptography. Interestingly, elliptic curves even play a role here: isogeny-based cryptography (an active area of post-quantum research) leverages the hard problem of finding isogenies (structure-preserving maps) between elliptic curves. Work by De Feo, Jao, and Pl\u00fbt (2011) on the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie\u2013Hellman (SIDH) protocol is one example of elliptic curve theory being used at the cutting edge of cryptography in a quantum-resistant way.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In summary, the intersection of elliptic curves and cryptography is one of mutual benefit. The deep algebraic structure of elliptic curves provided new secure cryptographic protocols, and the needs of cryptography have in turn driven new questions for mathematicians (for example, the need to efficiently compute on elliptic curves or to understand the distribution of secure parameters). Today, elliptic curve cryptography is a mature field, supported by a body of literature that includes both theoretical analysis and practical implementation guidelines (many published in venues like Advances in Cryptology and Springer\u2019s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series).</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/03/09/another-draft-of-the-scope-and-possible-structure-for-my-masters-thesis.html#key-contributors-and-institutions","title":"Key Contributors and Institutions","text":"<p>Elliptic curve research has been a global effort over many decades.

This theoretical progress is intertwined with deep conjectures like Birch\u2013Swinnerton-Dyer (E is for Elliptic Curves | Mathematical Institute) that continue to motivate current research. At the same time, elliptic curves have become a cornerstone of modern cryptography, enabling secure digital communication through elliptic curve cryptosystems (Curve Selection in Elliptic Curve Cryptography) (Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography \u2014 Evervault). Scholarly publications on elliptic curves are accordingly rich and diverse, appearing in pure mathematics journals (e.g. Annals of Mathematics, Inventiones Mathematicae), in computational and algorithmic venues (e.g. Mathematics of Computation, CRYPTO conference proceedings), and in expository books (many through Springer and other academic presses). The synergy between number theory and cryptography in the context of elliptic curves is often cited as a model for fruitful interaction between pure and applied research (Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography \u2014 Evervault). As we look ahead, the study of elliptic curves remains a vibrant domain.

Thanks for coming today, and welcome to my talk on Spectral Graph Theory - and what Daniel A. Spielman refers to as \"The Zoo of Graphs\".</p> <p>During this term, many of the examples I've seen of people introducing Spectral Graph Thewory (of just Graph Theory in general) have started with this particular caveat.</p> <pre><code>ANIMATION: that's not a graph, this is!\n</code></pre> <p>This is not a graph... not in terms of Graph Theory anyway... this is.</p> <p>Graph Theory is essentially the study of <code>nodes</code> (or <code>vertices</code> - as Daniel A. Spielman is a fan of saying: \"the terms will get used interchangably, sorry\"), and <code>edges</code>, the connections between each of the <code>nodes</code>. Combining this with some of the ideas behind Linear Algebra, gives us Spectral Graph Theory... a field that\u2019s equal parts mind-boggling, beautiful, and surprisingly practical.</p> <pre><code>SLIDE: What Is Spectral Graph Theory?\n\nBasic definition: \u201cSpectral\u201d relates to the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of matrices associated with graphs (e.g. adjacency matrix, Laplacian).\n\nWhy it matters: Bridges geometry, linear algebra, and combinatorics.\n</code></pre> <p>Spectral Graph Theory focuses on studying the properties of a graph through the <code>eigenvalues</code> and <code>eigenvectors</code> of matrices, such as the adjacency matrix  A  or the Laplacian matrix  L .</p> <p>Why do we do that? Because, somewhat surpsingly, you can figure quite out a lot about a <code>network</code> (or a <code>graph</code>) by how these <code>eigenvalues</code> behave \u2014 everything from connectivity, to mixing rates of random walks, to whether the graph is friendly to your favourite algorithms.</p> <p>If you\u2019re picturing some big, unweildy, massive matrix... good! That's often what the implementation of these ideas requires... but we'll keep it simple for today. Most of these qualities can be understood clearly by looking at smaller examples first.</p> <pre><code>ANIMATION - MANIM: Animate a small 3x3 or 4\u00d74 adjacency matrix appearing on the screen, each entry lighting up if there\u2019s an edge, going dark if there isn\u2019t.

As part of that, in my final year of study, I completed a unit called Science Report (SCI395), which can be viewed as a concise research or mini-project designed for undergraduate students.</p> <p>I had noticed the unit earlier in my studies and had been intrigued by the prospect of enrolling. It seemed like excellent preparation for postgraduate work, which is something I was keen to pursue.

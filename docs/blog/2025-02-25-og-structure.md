# Literature Review - Original Structure Ideas

## Version 0 (too long / complex)

- [] TODO: look back trough this work for ideas for extensions to the Lit Review, later

### **1. Introduction**

- **Context & Importance**
  - Elliptic curves in number theory, algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry.
  - Their role in Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem, BSD Conjecture, and modular forms.
- **Objective of the Review**
  - Focus on **historical evolution** and **pure theoretical aspects**.
  - High-level exploration of key conjectures / deeper structures / an "intro" that gives and idea of where we're going.
- **Structure Overview**
  - Maybe this section has to come last - once we know what's in and out / what the rest of it looks like

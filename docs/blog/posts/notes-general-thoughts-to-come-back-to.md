# Notes and Ideas

## Grapgh Theory and (EC) Finite Fields

Treat the \( p^2 \) points in a finite field as vertices of of a graph and join them in some way.

Connect each of these together in "some way".

It could be that each node \( P_1 \) is connected to another node \( P_y \) if \( P_x + P_1 = P_y \), where \( P_1 \) is some "starter node", which would seem to be an ordered pair - but could also noto be treated that way.

You could then move through, redefining each node as \( P_1 \), and connect all the nodes that are connected in this way...

It could be that each node \( P_x \) is connected to another node \( P_y \) if \( 2 P_x = P_y \)

## Multiplying / Dividing Points

Start with the idea that: \( P = k Q \).

Let \( k \), for now, be \( 2 \).

So \( P = 2 Q \). From which we can define, \( P/Q = 2 \). If we go through each point, and find all the examples of \( P_x / Q_x = 2 \) - i.e. all the points for which \( P_x = 2 Q_x \), what can we work out about the connection between these point? Especially if we algraically work out how \( P = 2 Q \) "works" and then work backward... to try to get an algrebraic definition of \( P/Q = x \).

Does this allow us to work out how to "divide points"?

## Kuratowski's Theorem

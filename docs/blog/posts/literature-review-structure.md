# Literature Review on Elliptic Curves - Defining the Scope

A first stab at the structure and scope for this stage of the Literature Review.

<!-- more -->

_(Master of Scientific Studies – Mathematics)_

## Version 1 (current / initial ideas)

### Proposed Structure for the Literature Review

---

#### **1. Introduction to Elliptic Curves**

- **Overview of Elliptic Curves**: Definitions, historical context, and importance in number theory and cryptography
- **Relevance of Elliptic Curves**: Applications in cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH), computational maths, factorisation
- **Research Questions**: Intro to questions we aim to address, especially finite fields, point division, and the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)

#### **2. Mathematical Foundations**

- **Algebraic Structures**: brief overview of algebraic structures relevant (groups, fields, finite fields).

  - simply link to [here](../../elliptic-curves/elliptic-curves-101/020-set-group-ring-field.md)?

- **Elliptic Curve Equation**: discussion of the equation $ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $ and properties.
  - simply link to [here](../../elliptic-curves/elliptic-curves-101/040-elliptic-curves-real.md)?
- **Point Addition and Doubling**: operations on elliptic curves and how they lead to group structures
  - simply link to [here](../../elliptic-curves/elliptic-curves-101/070-point-addition.md)?
- **Torsion Points and "Order of Points"**: Discussion of order of points in finite field and group structure of elliptic curves
  - relates to:
    - elliptic curve group being cyclic
    - cyclic groups of prime order / prime order groups
    - pairings and isogenies:
      - Weil & Tate Pairing: bilinear maps that introduce a sense of multiplicative structure to ECs, used in cryptography
      - Isogeny-Based Cryptography: how elliptic curve points relate to one another through algebraic maps, which sometimes introduce multiplicative-like behaviors

#### **3. Finite Fields and Their Role in Elliptic Curves**

- **Field Structures**: finite fields, focusing on \( \mathbb{F}_p \) (prime fields) and \( \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \) (extension fields)

- **Point Counting on Elliptic Curves**: _Schoof’s algorithm_ for counting points over finite fields / their relevance to cryptography and Discrete Logarithm Problem

  - If number of points on the curve is prime, the EC group is cyclic, meaning all points are generated by single generator \( P_1 \) such that: \( P_i = k P_1 \) for some integer \( k \). This means every point is a power of, which resembles multiplicative structure

- **Point Distribution and "Natural Order"**: finding natural order for points in finite fields, and how this order impacts cryptographic security

- **Behavior in Non-Prime Moduli**: how elliptic curves behave over composite moduli, with special focus on loops and chains of points in composite finite groups

#### **4. Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) and Elliptic Curves**

- **Introduction to DLP**: the discrete logarithm problem, why it's considered hard in the context of elliptic curves

  - simply link to [here](../../elliptic-curves/elliptic-curves-101/030-discrete-logarithm.md)?

- **Efficient Algorithms for DLP**: traditional methods for solving DLP (e.g., baby-step giant-step, Pollard's Rho), plus newer methods (index calculus, Weil descent)

- **Challenges in Cracking DLP**: challenges when solving DLP in large fields, and methods for efficiently computing discrete logarithms

- **Application in Cryptography**: securing elliptic curve cryptography systems, including impact of quantum computing (Shor's algorithm)

#### **5. Calculating Solutions in Finite Fields**

- **Methods for Finding Solutions**: solving elliptic curve equations over finite fields, even for very large moduli

- **Connection to Point Division**: How calculating solutions relates to point division and understanding the operation of dividing one elliptic curve point by another:

  - scalar multiplication inversion on ECs
  - group structure decomposition of EC points
  - algorithms for solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)
  - solving discrete logarithm problems in EC groups
  - inverse scalar multiplication in EC cryptography
  - division operations in EC groups

- **Efficient Point Division**: focus on how dividing points on elliptic curves can be approached computationally, connecting back to DLP
- **Polynomial Time Algorithms**: polynomial-time algorithms for solving elliptic curve equations, including **Montgomery curves**, and how these help in efficiently solving DLP

#### **6. Factorisation of Moduli and its Role in Elliptic Curve Computations**

- **Integer Factorisation and Elliptic Curves**: How factorisation of large numbers (e.g., in RSA) interacts with EC calculations, and the role of ECs in integer factorisation methods

- **Elliptic Curve Factorisation**: **Lenstra’s Elliptic Curve Method (ECM)** for factorisation, and other techniques

- **Factorising Non-Prime Moduli**: efficiently factorising composite moduli and its implications for understanding field behavior and elliptic curve operations

#### **7. Modern Applications and Current Research**

- **Cryptographic Applications**: the role of ECs in modern cryptographic protocols (ECDSA, ECDH, etc.), especially in context of finite fields and modular arithmetic.
- **Current Research Areas**:
  - Point Counting on Large Fields: New approaches / algos for efficiently counting points on ECs
  - Efficient Division of Points: new algos that could improve division of points in finite fields
  - Advances in DLP: New research on solving the discrete logarithm problem, especially composite fields or large moduli

??? question "Does this fit?"

    I'm not sure... I haven't got under the skin of how truely important QC is yet... and I don't know whether to go down this rabbit hole or not...

- **Impact of Quantum Computing**: A discussion of quantum-resistant algorithms and their potential impact on the use of elliptic curves in cryptography

#### **8. Conclusion and Future Directions**

- **Summary of Key Findings**: most relevant research and findings in review, focusing on how ECs behave in finite fields, point division, and DLP

- **Open Problems and Future Work**: discussion of areas that still require exploration, particularly in efficiently calculating point division, solving DLP in large finite fields, and factorisation in general

- **Personal Contribution**: how this work will contribute to the current state of research, particularly focusing on efficient algorithms / understanding the natural order of points in EC curve groups

# Notes

There was a previous version, I rejected, for complexity and size. It still contains ideas worth keepiong around - it can be seen [here](og-literature-review-structure.md).

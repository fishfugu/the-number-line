# This Blog – What It's All About

Last year, I graduated from my [Bachelor of Science (BSc)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) with the [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/study/courses/bachelor-of-science?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8q--BhDiARIsAP9tKI0Qu3pFI3EhIMgdgJObHIEcCArYRuviNrwXU59cKB92mjWQijiNdywaAq98EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&international=true). As part of that, in my final year of study, I completed a unit called [Science Report (SCI395)](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395), which can be viewed as a concise [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research) or [mini-project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project) designed for undergraduate students.

I had noticed the unit earlier in my studies and had been intrigued by the prospect of enrolling. It seemed like excellent preparation for [postgraduate work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education), which is something I was keen to pursue. In many ways, it felt like a _“small thesis”_ or _“introduction to research”_ for undergraduates.

So, I enrolled, searched for an [academic supervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_advisor) (which turned out to be a requirement), and started working on my project. The process of finding a supervisor was not entirely straightforward (I might write more about that later), but the key point is that I ended up working with [Dr. Jelena Schmalz](https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/jschmalz). Based on my broad interests—and given Dr. Schmalz’s longstanding engagement with [Elliptic Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) in particular—we agreed that Elliptic Curves would be a suitable topic for my Literature Review.

The output of that effort can be found here: [_The Case for Curves: Unravelling Elliptic Curves_](https://www.creativearts.com.au/maths/une/sci395).

# The Next Step… The New Degree

[The current (as of 2025) UNE Unit Information](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395) states:

> This unit offers you the opportunity to undertake a mini research project or literature review. Guided by an academic supervisor, you will develop in-depth knowledge in an area of scientific interest that you are passionate about and that fits with your course.

Now, to be completely transparent, having taken this course, I am still not entirely certain of the _formal_ or _comprehensive_ definition of a [Literature Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review). I navigated my way through reading, evaluating sources, and crafting my first (small, undergraduate-level) Literature Review somewhat intuitively, learning by doing and refining my approach as I went.

Moving forward, as a [postgraduate student](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education) looking to continue my work on [Elliptic Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) and preparing to produce a more advanced Literature Review for my next degree - the [Master of Scientific Studies](https://www.une.edu.au/study/courses/master-of-scientific-studies?international=true&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8q--BhDiARIsAP9tKI2-qtWa4cS04MIuti2h7bseMrEKWFZN9OMb8CqWx9UnGMYl5aE7c2AaAtanEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) - I find myself asking once again: **What exactly is a Literature Review?**

According to the Course Information for the Master's degree:

> Our coursework Master's degree gives you opportunities to future-fit your career by expanding on your expertise, upgrading your applied skills, and developing the advanced knowledge needed to solve complex problems in the rapidly changing world of science and technology.

This objective aligns with my desire to build upon my previous work - essentially copying the earlier material into a new site (so the old work can be archived) updating and improving that content, and then comprehesively extending it, and rewroking it into a broader **knowledge base** on the topic. My plan is to create a more expansive knowledge base for all my future mathematics-related research. For an outline of the site’s purpose and vision statement, please refer to the homepage [here](https://fishfugu.github.io/the-number-line/).

But I still find myself asking:

??? question "What is a trusted source?"

    Well… that is an excellent question, but beyond the scope of this post (and time constraints). I hope to return to this question later. It is a significant topic and not one to be addressed superficially.

# What Is a Literature Review?

In the spirit of what I currently understand about Literature Reviews, I will attempt to address this question by reviewing the prevailing opinions on the subject from what I consider **trusted sources**.

Some further reading on the subject:

- [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/student-academic-success/excel-at-writing/how-to-write/literature-review): A literature review is a **comprehensive overview of existing knowledge** on a specific topic. It involves **summarising, analysing, evaluating, and synthesising relevant sources**, such as **books, journal articles, and other scholarly works**. The purpose of a literature review is to:

  - provide context for your research,
  - identify gaps in current knowledge, and
  - highlight areas of **controversy** or **agreement** among scholars.

- [Purdue University](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/conducting_research/writing_a_literature_review.html): In academic writing, **a literature review can serve as a standalone document or as a section within a larger work**, such as a [thesis or dissertation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis). It helps establish the foundation of your research by demonstrating familiarity with the existing literature and clarifying how your work contributes to the ongoing scholarly dialogue.

- [Editage](https://www.editage.com/blog/what-is-literature-review-definition-types-and-examples/): This piece on _“What is Literature Review? Definition, Types and Examples”_ addresses some of my lingering questions about the forms a Literature Review can take and what is deemed appropriate. As a summary, there are different types of literature reviews, including:

  - **Narrative reviews**, which offer qualitative overviews of existing studies, and
  - **Systematic reviews**, which employ structured methodologies to evaluate and synthesise findings from multiple studies.

??? info "Yet More Reading on Lit Reviews"

    - [USC Libraries](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview): “… A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a re-organisation, or a reshuffling, of that information in a way that informs how you are planning to investigate a research problem.”
    - [WashU Libraries](https://libguides.wustl.edu/our?p=302677): “… While the main focus of an academic research paper is to support your own argument, the focus of a literature review is to summarise and synthesise the arguments and ideas of others.” - [The University of Edinburgh](https://institute-academic-development.ed.ac.uk/study-hub/learning-resources/literature-review): “… your task is to build an argument, not a library.”
    - [r/writing - I don’t understand how to write a literature review](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/qy6e5u/i_dont_understand_how_to_write_a_literature_review/?rdt=38422): “… it is not a summary of journal articles related to your topic… the reader wants to know (i) _what arguments did each article make_, (ii) _what results did each article discover_, and (iii) _how is that article related to your topic/argument_.”
    - [Wikipedia - Literature review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review): “… A good literature review has a proper research question, a proper theoretical framework, and/or a chosen research methodology.”

## What This Means for My Current Work

The Purdue University reference aligns with conversations I had with my supervisor about this Literature Review acting as a precursor to _“the project itself.”_ Although some logistical details (including timelines) remain unclear, the concept resonates with those discussions.

Additionally, the Editage piece mentioning **narrative reviews** reflects the general approach I intend to adopt. This qualitative, discursive method seems to suit my research goals well.

I would also like to call-out a repeated reference I saw, across much of my reading on the subject, to the idea of the difference between "**synthesis**" and "**summarisation**". While some texts refer to both equally, many emphasise the value, or necessity, of **synthesis** in a _good_ Literature Review. This feels like something I understood intuitively, from last year's reading on the subject, but something with became much clearer to my as I began work in my new Literature Review.

# Summary

This is just the beginning. There is considerably more to come.

This blog aims to document my process—not just for the Literature Review but for constructing _“the project itself”_ (tentatively called **The Number Line**) as time goes on. I hope it serves as a living record of my academic and research journey, highlighting both the structured knowledge I acquire and the informal reflections that surface along the way.

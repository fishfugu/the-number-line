# This Blog - What it's all about

Last year, I graduated from my [Bachelor Science Degree (BSc) with the University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/study/courses/bachelor-of-science?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8q--BhDiARIsAP9tKI0Qu3pFI3EhIMgdgJObHIEcCArYRuviNrwXU59cKB92mjWQijiNdywaAq98EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&international=true). As part of that, in my final year of study, I completed a unit called [Science Report](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395).

I had noticed the unit, earlier in my study - and had been excited by the prospect of enrolling in it. It sounded like a great preparation for higher studies - which is something I wanted to do. A kind of "small thesis / intro to research for undergrads".

<!-- more -->

And so I enrolled, shopped around for a supervisor (which it turned out I needed), and started work. The process of finding a supervisor wasn't obvious (I might write about that more, later)... but the salient point is: I ended finding [Dr. Jelena Schmalz](https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/jschmalz). Between the list of things I mentioned I was interested, and Dr. Schmalz's long term interest in Elliptic Curves specificially, we landed on Elliptic Curves, as the topic for my Literature Review.

The output of my work on this unit can be seen here: [_The Case for Curves: Unravelling Elliptic Curves_](https://www.creativearts.com.au/maths/une/sci395).

# The Next Step... the New Degree

[The current (as of 2025) UNE Unit Information](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395) states:

> This unit offers you the opportunity to undertake a mini research project or literature review. Guided by an academic supervisor, you will develop in-depth knowledge in an area of scientific interest that you are passionate about and that fits with your course.

Now - to be totally honest, having completed this course... I'm still not totally clear what the proper or total definition of a Literature Review is.

I muddled my way through the reading, and creeation of my first (small, undergrad) Literature Review, making up some the details as I went along... and working out what I should be doing... as I got there.

And so now - as a Post-Grad student, looking at continuing my work on Elliptic Curves, and staring down the barrel of needing to plan and produce a higher-level Literature Review for my next Degree ([Master of Scientific Studies](https://www.une.edu.au/study/courses/master-of-scientific-studies?international=true&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8q--BhDiARIsAP9tKI2-qtWa4cS04MIuti2h7bseMrEKWFZN9OMb8CqWx9UnGMYl5aE7c2AaAtanEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)), I find my self asking: what exactly is a Literature Review?

Again, the Course Information for the Master's degree says:

> Our coursework Master's degree gives you opportunities to future fit your career by expanding on your expertise, upgrading your applied skills, and developing the advanced knowledge needed to solve complex problems in the rapidly changing world of science and technology.

My idea was to build out the current work - by copying the prior material into a new site (so the old material could be archived) and to update it, and build on it... designing the new site as an extensible knowledge base for all of my future Maths research. For a full outline of the sites purpose, please see the homepage [here](https://fishfugu.github.io/the-number-line/).

But I still found myself asking:

??? question "What is a trusted source?"

    Well... that's a very good question, but beyond the scope of (or outside the time I have for) this post. I'll try to come back to this question later. It's a biggie... and not one I want to give a superficial answer to.

    In the sprit of what I, so far, understand about a Literature Review, I will attempt to answer the question, via a review of the recieved wisdom on the subject, from trusted sources.

# What is a Literature Review?

Some further reading on the subject:

- [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/student-academic-success/excel-at-writing/how-to-write/literature-review): ​A literature review is a **comprehensive overview of existing knowledge** on a specific topic. It involves **summarising, analysing, evaluating, and synthesising relevant sources**, such as **books, journal articles, and other scholarly works**. The purpose of a literature review is to:

  - provide context for your research,
  - identify gaps in current knowledge, and
  - highlight areas of controversy or agreement among scholars.

- [Purdue University](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/conducting_research/writing_a_literature_review.html): In academic writing, **a literature review can serve as a standalone document or as a section within a larger work**, such as a **thesis** or **dissertation**. It helps to establish the foundation of your research by demonstrating your understanding of the existing literature and how your work contributes to the ongoing scholarly conversation.

- [Editage](https://www.editage.com/blog/what-is-literature-review-definition-types-and-examples/): This piece on "_What is Literature Review? Definition, Types and Examples_" peaked my interest, as it tries to answer some of the questions in the back of my mind about the forms that a Literature Review could take, and what was considered appropriate. As a summary of this description: there are different types of literature reviews, including:

  - **narrative reviews**, which provide a qualitative summary of existing studies, and
  - **systematic reviews**, which use structured methods to analyse and synthesise findings from multiple studies.

## What this means for my current work

The Purdue University reference above resonated with some of the coonversations I had with my supervisor about this Literatuere Review being a pre-cursor to "the project itself". I am still working out some the details of what is required (and, importantly, by when...) - but this did align with those conversations.

Furthermore, the Editage piece above refers to **narative reviews**, which aligns very strongly with the approach I was planning on taking, in general.

??? info "Yet more reading on Lit Reviews"

    - [USC Libraries](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview): "... A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a re-organization, or a reshuffling, of that information in a way that informs how you are planning to investigate a research problem."
    - [WashU Libraries](https://libguides.wustl.edu/our?p=302677): "... While the main focus of an academic research paper is to support your own argument, the focus of a literature review is to summarize and synthesize the arguments and ideas of others."
    - [The University of Edinburgh](https://institute-academic-development.ed.ac.uk/study-hub/learning-resources/literature-review): "... your task is to build an argument, not a library"
    - [r/writing - I don’t understand how to write a literature review](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/qy6e5u/i_dont_understand_how_to_write_a_literature_review/?rdt=38422): "... it is not a summary of journal articles related to your topic... the reader wants to know (i) _what arguments did each article make_, (ii) _what results did each article discover_, and (iii) _how is that article related to your topic/argument_.
    - [Wikipedia - Literature review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review): "... A good literature review has a proper research question, a proper theoretical framework, and/or a chosen research methodology."

# Summary

This is just the beginning... There is a lot more to come....

This blog is intended to stand as a record of my process, not just for the Literature Review - but in constucting "the project itself" (working title "The Number Line"), as time goes on.

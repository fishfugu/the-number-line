## Background

Welcome to **Elliptic Curves 101**. The content for this section of The Number Line site was originally taken from: [The Case for Curves: Unraveling Elliptic Curves](https://www.creativearts.com.au/maths/une/sci395). This material was the output of Nicholas Gledhill's research project, supervised by [Dr. Jelena Schmalz](https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/jschmalz) at the [University of New England (UNE)](https://www.une.edu.au/), specifically for [the unit SCI395 - Science Report](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395).

The material has been copied here (and not simply linked to) so that it can be updated and improved over time, without the requirement to edit the original site. We will be updating the information here, to ensure it is as clear and helpful as possible.

## Introduction

**Elliptic curves** are a cornerstone of modern cryptographic systems. They have applications in, and generate interest in, many areas of:

- Number Theory
- Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry
- Complex Analysis
- Topology
- Dynamical (Chaotic) Systems

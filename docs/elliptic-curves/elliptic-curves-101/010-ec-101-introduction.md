# Elliptic Curves 101 - Introduction

## Background

Welcome to **Elliptic Curves 101**. The content for this section of The Number Line was originally taken from: [The Case for Curves: Unraveling Elliptic Curves](https://www.creativearts.com.au/maths/une/sci395).

This material was the output of a Research Project by Nicholas Gledhill, supervised by [Dr. Jelena Schmalz](https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/jschmalz) at the [University of New England (UNE)](https://www.une.edu.au/), for [the unit SCI395 - Science Report](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395).

## Introduction

**Elliptic curves** are a cornerstone of modern cryptographic systems. They have applications in, and generate interest in, many areas of:

- Number Theory
- Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry
- Complex Analysis
- Topology
- Dynamical (Chaotic) Systems

## Acknowledgements

First and foremost, let me say **thank you** to **[Dr. Jelena Schmaltz](https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/jschmalz)** for all of her support, guidance, energy, focus, ideas, and her continuing passion for her subject and her students. I could not have done this without your help and guidance. Our immediate connection on the subject matter was only the beginning of our journey. Your openness to ideas, your gentle navigation of advice, your sense of both the importance and the beauty of what we study, and your practical and straightforward approach to the subject matter were a joy to work with.

This work was completed as part of a course **[SCI395](https://www.une.edu.au/study/units/science-report-sci395)** with **[University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/)**, under the supervision of **Dr. Jelena Schmaltz**.

## Technology Stack

This site is built using **MkDocs** with the **Material for MkDocs** theme, enabling clean and modern documentation. The site is deployed using **GitHub Pages**, providing a fast and reliable hosting solution.

### **Platforms & Tools Used**

- **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)** – A static site generator that converts Markdown files into a structured documentation website.
- **[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)** – A highly customizable theme that enhances MkDocs with modern UI features and improved styling.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** – Used for running MkDocs and managing dependencies.
- **[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)** – Python’s package manager, used to install MkDocs and its dependencies.
- **[KaTeX](https://katex.org/)** – A fast math typesetting library used to render mathematical expressions in Markdown.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** – Version control and repository hosting for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** – Free static site hosting for this project.
- **[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/)** – Used for interactive mathematical visualizations and graphing.
- **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)** _(if applicable)_ – Provides security, performance optimization, and CDN caching for the site.

### **Hosting & Deployment**

The site is deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** using:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This ensures that changes pushed to the repository are quickly reflected on the live site.

For further details on how the site is built and maintained, see the **README** in [the repository](https://github.com/fishfugu/the-number-line).

A special thanks to **[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/)** (especially their **[2D](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and [3D](https://www.desmos.com/3d) graphing calculator**) for helping me build the visualizations and animations for this work.

## **Desmos**

To see the **Desmos graph** used to create the tangent lines in a finite field animation:

🔗 [Desmos Graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ak7ycoyblp)

This graph, while a working example, requires work to make it more readable and more easily reusable by others. It is my hope to find time to link to more of the graphs used to build this site (for others' use) and to further extend this work to a more shareable state.

📩 **Contact:** If extending this Desmos work would be of practical help, please contact **Nicholas Gledhill** (details below).

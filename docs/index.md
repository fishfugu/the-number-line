# Welcome to The Number Line

## Background

The Number Line project was inspired, originally, by the experience that Nicholas Gledhill had, creating [the output for his Literature Review on Elliptic Curves](https://www.creativearts.com.au/maths/une/sci395), in 2024.

After completing this course, Nicholas and his Supervisor ([Dr. Jelena Schmalz](https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/jschmalz)) agreed to extend the concept of this Literature Review to a "more general and better / deeper knowledgebase on Elliptic Curves" - as the output for his Masters' Literature Review, in 2025.

The idea behind creating The Number Line was to create a space in which Nicholas (and anyone who wanted to contribute material) could share the restults of our current and future reasearch in Mathematics.

The Number Line is the umbrella site / channel / stream / bog / vlog and general digital platform on which we plan to build out a number of explainers, videos, tools and other material on specific areas of Mathematics. This material is open and free to everyone who wants to use it. We hope you find it valuable to whatever it is you are researching or studying.

## Vision

The dream is to generate educational material at "Graduate Level Maths for Anyone" level - where Mathematicians, those casually interested in a specific topic for any reason, students, professionals who need to use this kind of maths in their work, the maths-curious, and any one simply maths-adjacent and looking for more details can all find helpful material on the topics we find the time to cover here.

We aim to do this - while still adhering to any and all of the standard rigorous academic guidlines and procedures for this kind of material, that make all of our output testable, fully reviewable and trustworthy.

We will link to any furhter channels and platforms through which The Number Line Material can be found are added, here, as they become available.

Feedback is sought from anyone with an opinion on the material presented here. Our aim is to do everything we can to make this mateiral and content as helpful as possible. Obviously, time is always a finite resource... so all aims presented here will be acheived on a "best efforts" basis. Please be patient with us.

Welcome!

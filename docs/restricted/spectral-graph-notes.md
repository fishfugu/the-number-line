# Spectral Graph Theory Notes

# Videos Watched (for reference)
- [Daniel Spielman “Miracles of Algebraic Graph Theory”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDMQR422LGM)
    - great overview of many of the ideas in the book we're already reading
- [Chapter 1 | The Beauty of Graph Theory (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXcCAAEDte0&t=1288s)
    - only watched up to 30:00

## Ideas for Assignment
- From Lena:
    - The easiest thing for an assessment task (assignment) would be the presentation of a couple of sections in chapter 5.
    - I also thought that you could compute some examples instead or with your presentation.
        - (You could for example prove and then illustrate Lemma  5.1.1. or Lemma 5.2.2.)
    - I was talking about Laplacian matrix and its eigenvalues for a path.
        - Can we find what are Laplacian eigenvalues for other graphs?
        - Is there also this interpretation/analogy with differential equations?
        - Maybe not, but we could try and think about this.

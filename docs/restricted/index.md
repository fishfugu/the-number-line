# The Number Line

## Restricted Access Area

This section of The Number Line site is designed to be a resticted access area.

But don't get too excited. All we're keeping here is notes on what needs to be done, and plans for the future site... so if you've got in here because you were super interested... have at it!! :-)

## The Big TODO list

- [ ] TODO: move the old site over to here

- [ ] TODO: _Elliptic Curves_ by Anthony W. Knapp. Get it from UNE and read.

### Section Elliptic Curves 101

- [ ] TODO: on the "point-addition" page - inmentions the idea of "the inflection point on curve where it shifts from -ve curvature to +ve curvature" - explore this idea in terms of the first and second derivative, in the weierstrass form, and the fact it represents a "triple root"

- [ ] TODO: on "point addition page - redo "Examples of Torsion Points" and try put in 5P = -P. But first, work out how to add P + 4P = 5P. It's easy if you do 2P + 3P, or even P + 4P = P - 2P = -P... but how do simple add P to 4P, when the line make a tangent with P? Do you simply have to assume the association that the tangent crosses at -2P... and there for P + 4P = P - 2P = -P?

- [ ] TODO: on "point addition page - check 4P is marked properly (should it be -4P) - and exlpain in detail that this is being found by doubling points

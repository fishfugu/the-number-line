## Meeting Notes

What is we should do

Elliptic Curves in Cryptography (by Werner?)

** Connection between different fields? **
Maybe not - used very differently.

******
Wrapping Real solutions up into cylinders repeatedly to show how real integer solutions in the reals become finite field solutions
******

Over Complex numbers might be good for pictures
Maybe too many pictures



Rational numbers - by difficult, need a lot more background "study 10 years"
Maybe more difficult to visualise but maybe we can "do something"



Resources: book by Washington
Elliptic Curves in finite Fields
Attacks on Discrete Logarithms


Find something on finite Field extensions: F_q -> F_p

Classical Book in Algebra:
Michael Artin, "Alebra" -- extensions of Fields




Gallois theory - "Gallois fields" for Finite Fields
Might be good for teaching material

Story of gallois of (Koshy?)




Lena Lecture Notes:
6. Elliptic Curves in Finite Field
How to construct the extension of the Field Mod 2 - F_2
Frobenius Endomomorphism
Hasse Theorem
Gallois Theory



"Gallois or Frobenius"
